## 🚀 Topics Covered

- ✅ Stage 1: Data structures & flow control (loops, conditionals, lists, dicts, sets)  
- ✅ Stage 2: Functions & error handling  
- ⏳ Stage 3: File I/O (CSV, JSON, text)  
- ⏳ Stage 4: Comprehensions & iterators  
- ⏳ Stage 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- 🧪 Extra: Real-world style mini-projects and data cleaning tasks

---

## 📝 Goals

- Build a solid, reusable Python foundation  
- Document learning clearly for future reference  
- Develop clean, maintainable code practices (functions, error handling, modular structure)  
- Create a public portfolio that demonstrates **practical coding ability**, not just theoretical knowledge

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

I’m learning Python with a focus on **data engineering**, so these exercises are designed to reflect real-world scenarios — filtering data, cleaning text, categorising values, building simple analysis pipelines, and handling errors gracefully.
